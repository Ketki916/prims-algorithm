# prims-algorithm

This code implements Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of an undirected weighted
graph. The input is an adjacency list of the undirected weighted graph and the output is the
adjacency list of the minimum spanning tree. The input must be type into the code, assigning
to the variable adjacencyList.
